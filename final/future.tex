\section{Future Work}
\label{future}
For future work, we are planning on applying SVM with different Kernels and compare the performance of them. Also, since the dataset seems easy to predict with $80\%$ of the comments as train set, we will study the accuracy of clasification methods on different proportions of train to test. We have also other similar datasets like Yelp on which same classification techniques can be applied. 

Another possible direction for future work is tag recommendation for different video categories. 
Tags are an important type of data that can be used by search algorithms to enhance the quality of results. 
If time permits, we will predict the category of a video given its tags. 
Using a generative method, the distribution function of tags given video category is computed. This distribution function may be used for automatic tag recommendations. Same techniques can be used to predict the distribution of tags based on review features.
A related work about tag recommendation and category discovery can be found in~\cite{tagRecCatDis}.
